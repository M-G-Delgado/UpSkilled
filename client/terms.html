    <!-- Terms and Conditions Content -->
    <section class="container mt-5 pt-5">
        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 27, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Scope and Acceptance</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the UpSkilled platform ("Platform"), including all services, features, and content provided by UpSkilled GmbH, Example Street 123, 60313 Frankfurt am Main, Germany ("we," "us," or "UpSkilled"). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms, forming a contract under § 305 BGB. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease use. These Terms apply to all users—learners, business partners ("Providers"), instructors, and visitors—regardless of registration status. Separate agreements (e.g., Provider contracts) may supplement these Terms but do not override them unless explicitly stated.</p>

        <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
        <p>For clarity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform</strong>: UpSkilled website, mobile app (if applicable), and related digital services.</li>
            <li><strong>User</strong>: Any individual or entity accessing the Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Learner</strong>: A User booking or attending workshops.</li>
            <li><strong>Provider</strong>: Businesses or instructors offering workshops via the Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Workshop</strong>: In-person training sessions, including single-day and multi-day intensives.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Points/Levels</strong>: Virtual gamification rewards with no monetary value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Services Provided</h2>
        <p>UpSkilled operates as a marketplace facilitating connections between Learners and Providers for in-person workshops across various fields (e.g., automotive, culinary, technology). We provide booking, payment processing, and gamification features but do not directly conduct workshops unless specified. As an intermediary (§ 7 TMG), we are not responsible for workshop execution. Services may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at our discretion, with notice where feasible.</p>

        <h2>4. Eligibility and Special Protections</h2>
        <h3>4.1 General Eligibility</h3>
        <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use the Platform (§ 2 JuSchG). Users under 18 require verifiable parental consent (§ 107 BGB), submitted to <a href="mailto:support@upskilled.de">support@upskilled.de</a>. You confirm legal capacity to contract (§ 104 BGB) or appropriate authorization if acting for an entity.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 Protected Groups</h3>
        <p>We comply with the **Behindertengleichstellungsgesetz (BGG)** and **Sozialgesetzbuch IX (SGB IX)** for persons with disabilities, and other protective laws:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reasonable accommodations (e.g., accessible venues) are requested via Providers, not guaranteed by us.</li>
            <li>Minors (under 18) and vulnerable adults (e.g., under guardianship, § 1896 BGB) are protected from exploitative content or overbooking; guardians may request restrictions.</li>
            <li>Underserved learners (e.g., low-income, refugees per § 1 AsylG) may access subsidized workshops, subject to verification, without altering these Terms.</li>
            <li>Providers must not discriminate against protected groups (§ 19 AGG); violations are their sole liability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Account Registration and Security</h2>
        <p>Account creation is optional for browsing but required for bookings and gamification. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information (§ 242 BGB).</li>
            <li>Maintain password confidentiality and not share credentials.</li>
            <li>Notify us immediately of unauthorized access at <a href="mailto:support@upskilled.de">support@upskilled.de</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are liable for all account activities (§ 278 BGB). We may suspend or terminate accounts for misuse (e.g., fraud, multiple registrations for Skill Point abuse), without compensation for lost data or points.</p>

        <h2>6. Booking and Payment</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Booking Process</h3>
        <p>Bookings form a contract between you and the Provider upon confirmation (§ 145 BGB). We facilitate this but are not a contractual party unless explicitly stated. Availability is not guaranteed; Providers may cancel or reschedule without our liability.</p>
        
        <h3>6.2 Pricing</h3>
        <p>Prices exclude VAT (19% per § 19 UStG) unless stated; total costs (including VAT and fees) are shown at checkout. Additional costs (e.g., materials, travel) are Provider-dependent and disclosed separately. We are not liable for pricing errors by Providers.</p>
        
        <h3>6.3 Payment</h3>
        <p>Payments are processed via third-party services (e.g., Stripe). You authorize charges to your payment method. Failed payments cancel bookings without notice. Chargebacks must be disputed with evidence (§ 675u BGB); frivolous disputes may lead to account suspension.</p>
        
        <h3>6.4 Special Cases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Group Bookings</strong>: One User books for multiple attendees; the booker assumes liability for payment and attendee conduct.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate Bookings</strong>: Businesses must provide authorization; we are not liable for internal disputes or employee no-shows.</li>
            <li><strong>Gift Vouchers</strong>: Non-refundable, valid for 3 years (§ 195 BGB), subject to Provider availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Provider Overbooking</strong>: We are not liable for Provider errors; remedies are with the Provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
        <h3>7.1 Consumer Right of Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>Under § 355 BGB, you have 14 days to withdraw from bookings without reason if the workshop hasn’t started. Notify us at <a href="mailto:support@upskilled.de">support@upskilled.de</a>. Refunds are processed within 14 days (§ 357 BGB). This right is waived if the workshop begins within 14 days and you proceed (§ 356(5) BGB).</p>
        
        <h3>7.2 UpSkilled 7-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h3>
        <p>We offer a voluntary 7-day money-back guarantee for dissatisfaction, subject to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attendance of at least the first session.</li>
            <li>Written request with a reason (e.g., "poor quality") to <a href="mailto:support@upskilled.de">support@upskilled.de</a> within 7 days of the workshop start.</li>
            <li>Prorated refunds for multi-day workshops (25% reduction per day attended).</li>
            <li>No eligibility for no-shows or cancellations within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Exclusion of payment fees and Provider material costs.</li>
            <li>Review and approval by us within 5 business days; we may deny frivolous claims (e.g., "changed mind").</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>7.3 Standard Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>Cancellations 24+ hours before a workshop start time receive a full refund. Within 24 hours or no-shows are non-refundable unless Providers agree otherwise. We are not liable for Provider cancellations; remedies depend on Provider policies.</p>
        
        <h3>7.4 Special Cases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medical Emergencies</strong>: Full refunds with documentation (e.g., doctor’s note) within 7 days, at our discretion.</li>
            <li><strong>Provider No-Show</strong>: Full refund or rescheduling if verifiable; we are not liable beyond facilitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Events</strong>: No refunds unless Providers cancel; rescheduling is Provider-dependent.</li>
            <li><strong>Force Majeure</strong>: No refunds for cancellations due to uncontrollable events (e.g., pandemics, strikes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with German law and respect others’ rights (§ 903 BGB).</li>
            <li>Not misuse the Platform (e.g., hacking, Skill Point manipulation).</li>
            <li>Adhere to Provider rules (e.g., safety, conduct).</li>
            <li>Assume personal risk for workshop activities (e.g., tool use, physical exertion).</li>
            <li>Indemnify us against claims from your actions (e.g., property damage, injury to others) (§ 254 BGB).</li>
            <li>Not resell bookings without consent; violations void refunds.</li>
            <li>Ensure minors under your supervision comply (§ 832 BGB).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Breaches may lead to immediate account termination, loss of Skill Points, and legal action.</p>

        <h2>9. Provider Responsibilities and Protections Against Providers</h2>
        <h3>9.1 General Duties</h3>
        <p>Providers agree via separate contracts to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver workshops as advertised (e.g., content, duration).</li>
            <li>Maintain safety standards (§ 618 BGB).</li>
            <li>Handle Learner data per GDPR and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li>Not misrepresent offerings or overbook beyond capacity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>9.2 Protections Against Malicious Conduct</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fraudulent Listings</strong>: We are not liable for Providers posting deceptive workshop details (e.g., fake credentials); Providers indemnify us against Learner claims (§ 249 BGB).</li>
            <li><strong>Intentional Harm</strong>: No liability for Providers intentionally harming Learners (e.g., sabotage, theft); Providers are solely responsible (§ 823 BGB).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Misuse</strong>: Providers breaching GDPR (e.g., selling Learner data) indemnify us for fines or damages (§ 280 BGB).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>9.3 Protections Against Negligence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Poor Quality</strong>: No liability for substandard workshops (e.g., untrained instructors); Providers bear refund or rescheduling costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Failures</strong>: No liability for injuries from Provider negligence (e.g., unsafe tools); Providers assume full responsibility (§ 831 BGB).</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellations</strong>: No liability for Provider no-shows or last-minute cancellations; Providers must remedy directly with Learners.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>9.4 Protections Against Simple Errors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scheduling Mistakes</strong>: No liability for Provider errors (e.g., double-booking); Providers correct at their expense.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing Errors</strong>: No liability for Provider misquotes; Learners pay listed price, with Providers covering discrepancies.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Errors</strong>: No liability for minor inaccuracies (e.g., typos in descriptions); Providers must honor advertised terms or refund.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may suspend Providers for violations, retaining commission payments as liquidated damages (§ 340 BGB). Providers waive claims against us for Platform-related losses (e.g., revenue from cancellations).</p>

        <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Platform content (e.g., text, images, code) is owned by UpSkilled or licensed under § 2 UrhG. Unauthorized use (e.g., recording workshops) is prohibited (§ 97 UrhG). User content (e.g., reviews) grants us a perpetual, non-exclusive license. Providers warrant their content does not infringe third-party rights; violations indemnify us (§ 249 BGB).</p>

        <h2>11. Gamification Features</h2>
        <p>Skill Points and Levels are virtual, non-monetary rewards. We may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjust or discontinue with 30 days’ notice.</li>
            <li>Forfeit points for violations (e.g., fraud).</li>
            <li>Not compensate for losses due to errors or termination.</li>
            <li>Limit points for subsidized or pilot workshops.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Providers cannot manipulate points; attempts void their earnings.</p>

        <h2>12. Liability</h2>
        <h3>12.1 General Liability</h3>
        <p>We are liable for intent and gross negligence (§ 521 BGB). For slight negligence, liability is limited to foreseeable, contract-typical damages, capped at €1,000 per incident (§ 309 Nr. 7 BGB).</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>12.3 Special Scenarios</h3>

        </ul>

        <h2>13. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Providers mishandling data indemnify us for breaches.</p>

        <h2>14. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may terminate via <a href="mailto:support@upskilled.de">support@upskilled.de</a>. We may terminate for breaches (e.g., fraud, safety threats) without notice (§ 314 BGB), forfeiting points and refunds.</p>
